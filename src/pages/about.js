      <p>
        After 13 years in media, marketing, and academic advising, I decided to
        shift from <i class="low-voice">not a real science</i> social sciences
        to IT sector. Before I realized how much I love CSS, JS &amp; co I
        studied
        <strong>
          project management, software development, and electronic services
        </strong>
        . Combined with my soft skills, these studies equipped me with a broad
        expertise in technologies that can make the Web a better place.
